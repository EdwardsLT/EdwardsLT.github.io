Welcome to my personal webpage. My research interest is in the field of strongly correlated electron systems. I enjoy using neutrons, x-rays and bulk probes to understand the physical properties of these materials. My other interests include the development of in-situ instrumentation for beamline experiments and analysis tools for single crystal (diffuse) scattering, contributing to the Mantid project.
